# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Brandon.

ðŸ”­ I have a developer youtube channel, [CodeWithBrandon](https://www.youtube.com/user/brandcaul), that's been featured on [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/).

ðŸ“š I also wrote a book, [JavaScript For ABAP Developers](https://www.sap-press.com/javascript-for-abap-developers_5359/). 

ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with
- [JavaScript Cheat Sheet](https://github.com/brandoncaulfield/javascript-cheat-sheet)
- [Advanced UI5 Snippet Generator](https://github.com/brandoncaulfield/advanced-ui5-snippet-generator) (VS Code)
- [Advanced ABAP Snippet Generator](https://github.com/brandoncaulfield/advanced-abap-snippet-generator) (VS Code)
